# theCounter
Hello! What you are about to see is a simple web app consisting of a counter that decrement/increment a given value (starting from 0 or from a random number between 0 and 100).</br>
This counter was build almost entirely with JavaScrpt (DOM elements included) and is a part of my journey on the path to become a developer.</br>
No software is needed to use the counter: you can download its source code and run it on your IDE of choice, or you can click on this link and use it in your browser -> .
Hope you enjoy it!
