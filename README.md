# theCounter
Hello! What you are about to see is a simple web app consisting of a counter that decrements/increments a given value (starting from 0 or from a random number between 0 and 100).</br>
This counter was built almost entirely with JavaScript (DOM elements included) and is part of my journey on the path to become a developer.</br>
No software is needed to use the counter: you can download its source code and run it on your IDE of choice, or you can click on this link and use it in your browser -> https://papaya-beignet-c564d3.netlify.app/.</br>
Hope you enjoy it!
